# Autonomous Line-Following Vehicle Project

This project is a semester-long prototyping course assignment where we design, build, and program an autonomous vehicle. The primary goals of this project are:

- To design a basic autonomous vehicle system using sensors and microcontrollers.
- To build a vehicle that can follow a black line using IR sensors.
- To incorporate obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors.
- To stop or avoid obstacles at a specified range (15 cm).
- To demonstrate knowledge of circuit design, simulation, mechanical CAD, and embedded programming.

The vehicle is built around an **Arduino Uno** and uses the following key components:

- **Two DC motors** (for propulsion)
- **Two IR sensors** (for line following)
- **Two ultrasonic sensors** (for obstacle detection)
- **A color sensor** (for extended functionality)

The repository is structured into the following folders:

- [`3d models`](./3d%20models/): 3D printable files and CAD designs.
- [`code`](./code/): Arduino source code for vehicle control.
- [`diagrams`](./diagrams/): Circuit schematics and system diagrams.
- [`multism`](./multism/): Circuit simulation files using Multisim.
- [`tinkercad`](./tinkercad/): Tinkercad simulation links and supporting assets.

Each folder contains its own README with more specific instructions, files, and relevant links.
