# 3D Models

This folder contains the 3D designs for the vehicle chassis and mounting brackets used in our autonomous vehicle project.

## Contents

- `.stl` and `.step` files for 3D printing.
- Fusion 360 or SolidWorks project files (if applicable).

## How to Use

1. Open the `.step` or `.f3d` files using a compatible CAD program.
2. Modify dimensions or features if needed to fit specific components.
3. Export as `.stl` for slicing and 3D printing.

## Notes

- All models are designed with standard Arduino Uno dimensions in mind.
- Mounting holes for motors, sensors, and the Arduino are pre-aligned.
