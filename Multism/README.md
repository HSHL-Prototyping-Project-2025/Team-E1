# Multisim Simulations

This folder contains circuit simulations built using NI Multisim to test portions of our electronic design before physical implementation.

## Contents

- `.ms14` files: Multisim project files
- Simulation results as screenshots or reports

## How to Use

1. Open the `.ms14` file in NI Multisim.
2. Run the simulation to verify circuit behavior.
3. Adjust component values or layouts as needed.

> **Note**: These simulations primarily test IR sensor response and motor logic control.
